- CodeChef: [CodeChef Profile](https://www.codechef.com/users/shahbaz898khan)

Why I'm a Good Fit:

With a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Electronics and Computer Science and extensive experience in full-stack development, I bring a robust skill set that aligns well with the requirements of the Software Engineer Intern position. My internships at Pyramid Developers and NULL CLASS have equipped me with hands-on experience in modern web technologies, including React Native, Flutter, Node.js, and MongoDB. 



In my recent role at Pyramid Developers, I successfully reduced file size by 20% through code optimization and implemented containerization strategies using Docker, which streamlined deployment and scalability. My ability to work within agile frameworks and collaborate effectively with diverse teams was demonstrated during my internship at GSSOC24, where I contributed to open-source projects and optimized code for better efficiency.

Furthermore, my experience as a mentor at TLE, where I guided students in competitive programming and problem-solving, has honed my communication and leadership skills. My dedication to continuous learning is evident from my self-employed stint at YouTube, where I created 130+ educational videos on various programming languages and development tools.

I am confident that my technical proficiency, problem-solving abilities, and passion for software development make me a strong candidate for this internship. I am eager to contribute to Dots and grow alongside your talented team.

Thank you for considering my application. I am looking forward to the opportunity to discuss how my background, skills, and certifications can contribute to the continued success of Dots.

Best regards,

Shahbaz Khan
