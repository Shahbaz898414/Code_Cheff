Hello,

I genuinely would like to say Thanks to you guys for showing interest in working with us. !

Currently, we are working on a very exciting Project - the "Sellerkin" SAAS Tool - The purpose of this tool is 

to help e-commerce sellers to find the winning products and keyword volume.

Sellerkin Tech Stack - MERN is Useds, so, whatever you create, please create acc. to this tech stack in mind 

There are 2 Tasks, you have to do any one task from these two:- 

1. You have to create a Sales Feature for listings available for the Product finder feature for Sellerkin

Sales data can't be fetched directly from Etsy APIs because there is no endpoint in Etsy documentation to fetch that data

But still, if you would like to use Etsy APIs to fetch listings or maybe need to build an algorithm using views or favorites, if that is the case, 

please share your approach at sellerkin@gmail.com and we'll share API keys with you

To understand more about the sales feature, you can check alura.io, everbee.io and check sales feature of it to understand in better way

You can signup on to these websites for a free trial 

Note: - Only work on sales feature no need to fetch other results of Product Finder 

2. You need to create a Keyword Search Volume feature for the Etsy.com platform 

Keyword search volume - It simply means how many times that specific keyword searched per monthly basis on etsy.com 

for example - if someone searches " Ring " and like to know how much the keyword search volume for " Ring "

on etsy.com then we need to show the more expected keyword search volume - it could be 10000 or 8762 or anything - this is the feature 

we need to create. 

To understand more about the market - You can check out the tools - alura.io, etsyhunt, everbee.io - how keyword  search volume displayed 

on these tools 

Once you do any task, please deploy it on render or vercel, it's free and send it to us at sellerkin@gmail.com

Then we'll have a meet for a final call 

3. You must know how to crawl any web pages ( links or images )

If not understood properly, please read it multiple times still you feel we left something, please feel free to ask. 

Internship Period - We are looking for an intern for at least 2 months
